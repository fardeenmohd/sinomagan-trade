# Sino Magan Next

This is a Next.js project designed with a custom brand identity and modern web technologies.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

This project utilizes the following technologies and libraries:

- **Next.js**: The React Framework for production, offering server-side rendering and static site generation.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework used for styling the application with a custom configuration.
- **Unsplash**: Configured to serve optimized remote images via `next/image`.

## 🎨 Design System

The project features a tailored design system configured in `tailwind.config.js`:

- **Typography**: A highly optimized font stack that mimics the native system font (Apple System, San Francisco, Segoe UI) for a seamless user experience.
- **Brand Colors**:
  - Navy (`#001a33`)
  - Copper (`#b87333`)
  - Crimson (`#990000`)
  - Slate (`#475569`)
